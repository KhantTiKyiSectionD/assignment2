The main reason for the website is to show about the service and the product the user can get at stella jewerly
I used the smiple background so that it can give premium so that the customer feels like there are buying something luxurious
I keep the design and font simple as much as possible so that the user dont have any misunderstanding
I also used flexbox so that my image can look more organised and it can be diveded into catogries so that i can make user more easy to find
Display flex: This aligns the image and text side by side on larger screens
The color for the website that i used will be more light color so that its giving the cool version for the eye
Font Choice: The font Open Sans, sans-serif was selected for its clean, modern look
The website was designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on different screen sizes
I also add Interactive Elements and Hover Effects
To enhance user interaction and guide attention to key areas, hover effects were applied
The hover effect on navigation links changes the text color to gold (#ffd700)
Buttons are styled with a gold background and change to a slightly darker shade when hovered
Finally i run the code in different website to make sure that it works for user
